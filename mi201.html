        <center><h3>Analysis of Strava's Social Media Presence</h3></center>
	<center><p>Strava is a social media company made specifically for athletes. The social network is primarily focused on their mobile app so users can take advantage of the GPS aspect of the app to keep track of their workout and then share with their users. The company allows for users to track their workouts and to build a community around their athletic accomplishments. As Strava is a social network company, they still need to advertise and build a strong user base for their network and they do this by using a combination of strategies. Strava has their own blog, they post YouTube videos to their channel and they interact with users on Twitter and Facebook.</p></center>
	<center><p>Strava's social media profiles includes 2 Facebook accounts based on the main activity of the user (Running/Cycling), <a href='http://twitter.com/strava'>Twitter</a> and <a href='http://www.youtube.com/user/StravaInc'>Youtube</a>. Strava has an <a href='https://www.instagram.com/stravacycling/?hl=en'>Instagram</a> but it is not promoted through their official website. Their website includes a <a href='http://www.blog.strava.com'>blog</a> that contains fresh material meant to engage readers by pertaining to their interest in health and fitness. By interacting more with users on different social media, they help broaden their audience and be aware of what users are looking for when they look at Strava for content.</p></center>
	<center><p>Strava tends to be active on all of their social media fronts but they especially tend to give praise through these accounts to their users for being active and for using Strava to track their workouts. These types of posts tend to showcase how users tend to use the social network and how versatile the app can be. Users can show off their workouts on other social media or mention Strava in a tweet, like the tweet below does.</p></center>
	
	<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stra-vanity; noun. The act of a rank amateur referring to themselves as an &#39;athlete&#39; on Strava <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cycling?src=hash">#cycling</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/strava?src=hash">#strava</a></p>&mdash; Pete (@ragtimecyclist) <a href="https://twitter.com/ragtimecyclist/status/801831793875963905">November 24, 2016</a></blockquote></center>

	<center><p>Since it is a social network, Strava tends to retweet or show more posts of users using their product by showing off their interface. The tweet below is by a pro cycling company showing how well one of their riders did by showing how fast and how far she went in her race, which is a good example of the company both promoting their own business and Strava at the same time.</p></center>
	
	<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What a great ride in Drenthe we just had! Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/marianne_vos">@marianne_vos</a>&#39; route on <a href="https://twitter.com/Strava">@Strava</a>. <a href="https://t.co/sxXomXHiiS">https://t.co/sxXomXHiiS</a> <a href="https://t.co/AYK9GbtNQf">pic.twitter.com/AYK9GbtNQf</a></p>&mdash; WM3 Pro Cycling (@WM3ProCycling) <a href="https://twitter.com/WM3ProCycling/status/801417449220567040">November 23, 2016</a></blockquote></center>

	<center><p>Since Strava's social network is used mainly through their <a href='http://www.strava.com/mobile'>mobile app</a>, they focused on promoting their app more than their website and they tried to appeal to both Android and iPhone users. Through the app, users can track their activity or sync it with another fitness device and people will be able to comment or give you kudos for each workout. Users are able to feature Strava and mention the brand on Instagram based on their enjoyability of the application. </p></center>
	<center><p>Several blogs mention using Strava to track their progress and to be competitive through an app. This <a href='http://www.therunnerbeans.com/2016/08/gaming-make-fitter.html'>blog post</a> talks about how the featured blogger's friends use Strava for competitive races in order to increase motivation and how one friend was using it to display her cycling progress to fundraise for a charity. The 2nd <a href='http://furthermore.equinox.com/articles/2013/09/geraint-thomas'>blog post</a> interviews a pro cyclist and talks about how he trains. He discussed how he used Strava to compare his times with others and keep track of his goals. With their app being so accessible and usable, it makes it easier for bloggers and users to mention the app without worrying others will not be able to understand what it is.</p></center>

	<center><p>Strava's Instragram page makes it easier for athletes to post their workout and interact with their company. People are able to engage with Strava and show others how well their workout went. Strava is able to have their users market their product out and also attract more people who tend to share the same interests as Strava's users or Strava. The Instagram below showcases Strava's relationship with users over social media. Strava sponsored the pictured cyclist (as seen by the Strava logo on his jersey) who then posted a picture and mentioned strava in his comments.</p></center>

	<center><p>Another way Strava uses social media is that they have a Youtube page where they post videos not especially about their product and what the company is capable of but more in line with their users' interests. People who tend to use Strava are more likely to be health-conscious and active so that is why Strava focuses their YouTube videos and even their whole blog around fitness and health topics. Cyclists and runners have a tendency to use Strava more in order to aid their workouts and the video below does a good job in showing others can improve their workouts. It shows by focusing more on the data Strava provides and the competitive aspect Strava provides in order to improve cyclists' times and pace.</p></center>
