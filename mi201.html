        <center><h3>Analysis of Strava's Social Media Presence</h3></center>
	<center><p>Strava is a social media company made specifically for athletes. The social network is primarily focused on their mobile app so users can take advantage of the GPS aspect of the app to keep track of their workout and then share with their users. The company allows for users to track their workouts and to build a community around their athletic accomplishments. As Strava is a social media company, they still need to advertise and build a strong user base for their network and they do this by using a combination of strategies. Strava has their own blog, they post youtube videos to their channel and they interact with users on Twitter and Facebook.</p></center>
	<center><p>Strava's social media profiles includes 2 Facebook accounts based on the main activity of the user (Running/Cycling), <a href='http://twitter.com/strava'>Twitter</a> and <a href='http://www.youtube.com/user/StravaInc'>Youtube</a>. Strava has an <a href='https://www.instagram.com/stravacycling/?hl=en'>Instagram</a> but it is not promoted through their official website. Their website includes a <a href='http://www.blog.strava.com'>blog</a> that contains fresh material meant to engage readers by pertaining to their interest in health and fitness. By interacting more with users on different social media, they help broaden their audience and be aware of what users are looking for when they look at Strava for content.</p></center>
	<center><p>Strava tends to be active on all of their social media fronts but they tend to give praise through these accounts to their users for being active and for using Strava to track their workouts. These types of posts tend to showcase how users tend to use the social network and how versatile the app can be. Users tend to show off their workouts on other social media or mention Strava in a tweet, like the tweet below does.</p></center>
	
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stra-vanity; noun. The act of a rank amateur referring to themselves as an &#39;athlete&#39; on Strava <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cycling?src=hash">#cycling</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/strava?src=hash">#strava</a></p>&mdash; Pete (@ragtimecyclist) <a href="https://twitter.com/ragtimecyclist/status/801831793875963905">November 24, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

	<center><p>Since it is a social network, Strava tends to retweet or show more posts of users using it. The tweet below is by a pro cycling company showing how well one of their riders did by showing how fast and how far she went, which is a good example of the company both promoting their own business and Strava at the same time.</p></center>
	
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What a great ride in Drenthe we just had! Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/marianne_vos">@marianne_vos</a>&#39; route on <a href="https://twitter.com/Strava">@Strava</a>. <a href="https://t.co/sxXomXHiiS">https://t.co/sxXomXHiiS</a> <a href="https://t.co/AYK9GbtNQf">pic.twitter.com/AYK9GbtNQf</a></p>&mdash; WM3 Pro Cycling (@WM3ProCycling) <a href="https://twitter.com/WM3ProCycling/status/801417449220567040">November 23, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

	<center><p>Since Strava's social network is used mainly through their <a href='http://www.strava.com/mobile'>mobile app</a>, they focused on promoting their app more than their website and they tried to appeal to both Android and iPhone users. Through the app, users can track their activity or sync it with another fitness device and people will be able to comment or give you kudos for each workout. Users are able to feature Strava and mention the brand on Instagram due to their enjoyability of the application. </p></center>
	<center><p>Several blogs mention using Strava to track their progress. This <a href='http://www.therunnerbeans.com/2016/08/gaming-make-fitter.html'>blog post</a> talks about how the blogger's friends use Strava for competitive races in order to increase motivation and how one friend was using it to display her cycling progress to fundraise for a charity. The 2nd <a href='http://furthermore.equinox.com/articles/2013/09/geraint-thomas'>blog post</a> interviews a pro cyclist and talks about how he trains. He discusses how he uses Strava to compare his times with others and keep track of his goals.</p></center>
